PROJECT TITLE: Customer Pain Point Discovery Agent

PROJECT PURPOSE/JUSTIFICATION:
Build an AI agent that automatically discovers customer pain points from multiple online sources 
(Reddit, Twitter, web search) to demonstrate modern AI/ML skills for job applications.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
An intelligent agent using LangChain and OpenAI that:
- Accepts user query (e.g., "What pain points do B2B product managers face?")
- Searches multiple data sources (Reddit, Twitter, Google)
- Extracts and categorizes pain points using LLM
- Presents structured findings in Streamlit dashboard

HIGH-LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Agent must search at least 3 data sources
2. Output must be structured (JSON/table format)
3. Must include source citations
4. Response time < 2 minutes
5. Streamlit UI must be intuitive for non-technical users
6. Deployed publicly (Streamlit Cloud)
7. Full documentation on GitHub

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Agent correctly identifies pain points from 10 test queries (80%+ accuracy)
- All team members can demo the project
- Code reviewed and documented
- Live URL shareable in resumes/LinkedIn

HIGH-LEVEL RISKS:
- API rate limits (Reddit, Twitter, OpenAI)
- Team members getting jobs mid-project
- API costs exceeding budget ($50 limit)
- Complexity of multi-tool agent orchestration

SUMMARY MILESTONE SCHEDULE:
- Phase 1 - Reddit integration + basic agent
- Phase 2 - Add Twitter + Google Search
- Phase 3 - UI polish + error handling
- Phase 4 - Deployment + documentation

SUMMARY BUDGET:
- OpenAI API: $10-15
- Reddit API: Free
- Twitter API: $0-5 (basic tier)
- Google Search API: $0 (100 queries/day free)
- Streamlit Cloud: Free
- Total: $10-20

PROJECT APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS:
Team consensus on major decisions (scope, tools, timeline)
